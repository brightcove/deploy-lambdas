deploy-lambdas
===
Lambda(s) to help with deploys. Scripts will contain further documentation.

Installation
---
Right now nothing too fancy...generate zips which can be uploaded to Lambda.
`npm` is used for a build system, to generate zip file(s) run:

```
npm dist
```

and then do whatever with the created zips in the dist folder.
